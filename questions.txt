1. One of the proudest momest of my life happened last spring. For four years I played club lacrosse at UNF. When I first got to unf 
the program was barely hanging on by a thread. 
But years of work we built the team up and won a conference championship, as well as finsihing 5th in the nation. Winning that championship
was the first time in my life I won a championship in lacrosse. And it was my last season, which made it even better

2. I follow a lot of web dev subreddits, the community shares their own projects, and the lastest things buzzing around the web dev world. I would recommend someone
a reddit to join these sub reddit. I learn new tricks everytime I go on reddit, I usually apply the tricks during my freetime or at work. It helps keep me ahead.
